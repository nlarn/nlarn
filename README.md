Welcome to NLarn!
=================

The goal of the game is to find the potion to cure your daughter from the
illness "dianthroritis" and bring it back home. Time is finite - when you
return to your home, the doctor will tell you how much time is left. In
NLarn, time is measured in mobuls. A mobul consists of 100 turns. You can
see the number of turns elapsed in the status bar on the right, prefixed
with **T**.

The game consists of a home town, and two dungeons: the caverns of Larn and
the volcano. The potion is hidden inside the volcano, which is unfortunately
populated by dragons and demons. To be able to fight the latter, you have to
gain experience and wealth by fighting through the caverns. The equipment
available in the DND store in town is expensive, but will help you to survive
in the volcano long enough to find the potion. To earn money, you can collect
gems in the caverns and sell them to the bank.

The entrance of the caverns is depicted by the letter **O**; the shaft leading
down to the volcano by the letter **I**.

You can get help in the game by pressing **?** or **F1**.

## Game configuration

The game can be configured from the main menu.

The configuration is persisted in the file `nlarn.ini`. The game writes
the configuration to the directory `~/.nlarn` on Linux, BSD and macOS,
or to the folder `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nlarn` on Windows.

Comments above the individual setting explain the possible settings.


## Heritage

NLarn is modeled after Larn, which was written by Noah Morgan in 1986.
There is a [Wikipedia article on Larn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larn_%28video_game%29).

Later in the eigthies, Phil Cordier created ULarn, an extended version of
Larn. It comes with more levels, items and adds character classes to the
game.

NLarn tries to maintain the atmosphere and story of the last version of
Larn (12.3) while improving game-play and user experience. Only a few of
the additions of Ularn have been included.
