Release 0.7.1 (2012-05-27)
-------------

### Changes:
* More armour:
  * a simple cloak.
  * Boots of Speed (unique).
  * Cloak of Invisibility (unique).
* Weapons can break during combat. The number of broken weapons is
  counted and shown in the postmortem.
* Make damaged items less effective: burnt, corroded or rusty weapons
  and ammunition will now cause less damage, damaged armour will protect
  less.
* Redesigned armour and weapon distribution in the dungeon. The elven
  chain is more heavy and unique.
* Reduced the availability of items in the store.
* Replaced the amulet of invisibility by the amulet of sustainment,
  which protects against attribute draining attacks.
* The bank pays less interest on player's savings.
* Increased school course prices. The course prices now depend on the
  length of the course, thus maintaining the balance between benefit
  and cost.
* Raise item identification and repair prices. The prices will now depend
  on the item's value. For lower-prices items the minimum charge stays at
  50 gold. Repair prices for item stacks depend on the amount of items.
* Generate monster item adequate to dungeon level. Previously troglodytes
  on dungeon level 3 could carry an amulet of power, which was not
  desirable. Another effect of this change is that monsters in the deep
  dungeon levels carry more interesting items.
* Do not erode items inside containers.
* Implemented scroll of hold monster. This scroll was in error set up as
  a scroll that affects the player, and as the effect "hold monster" has
  no effect on the player, this mistake went unnoticed until now.
* Reduced the range of enlightenment.
* Wizard Mode: allow to select stationary objects as teleport destination
  (as for auto-travel).
* Improved the help file.
* Modernised the Windows Installer.
* Windows Resources now allow icons for the executable and embedded
  dynamic version information in the executable.
* Accept ^U/^D in the inventory, spell list and message windows as
  PGUP/PGDOWN.
* Expanded scores in the memorial file onto two lines. This avoids ugly
  wraps and allows to display more information. Spelled out explanational
  remarks and added the dungeon level.
* Enhanced saving the memorial file:
  * Save the file in the user's home directory;
    on Windows save it under "My Documents".
  * Offer to chose a new file name if a file exists.
  * Wrap and indent long lines at column 78.
  * Choose the line terminator matching the platform.
* Implemented working setgid for system-wide installations on \*nix systems.

### Fixed bugs:
* Adapted the map loading code to native EOL. This fixes unreachable
  areas when playing on Windows (reported by many).
* Fixed enlightenment for the upper left corner of the map
  (Reported by Krice).
* Fixed a crash after shooting the last ammo.
* Ensure player's experience can not sink below zero. This fixes a crash
  that occurred when drinking from a fountain and loosing more experience
  than the player has.
* Calculate adjacent monsters while enlightened. This fixes targeting
  and allows to abort running or auto-travel.
* Fixed increase of spell effect duration when casting a spell known at
  a higher level of knowledge multiple times.
* Prevent swapping cursed weapons.
* Fixed the descriptions for item stacks in the shop (use the plural form
  when applicable).

  success only after the time is passed. Fixed the order of messages
  when climbing out of a pit.
* Fixed ranged attacks to monsters over water/lava.
* Waste ammo when dropped on deep water or lava.
* Slings and bows are two-handed weapons, too.
* Recalc burdened status after fighter courses.

  educational purpose.

Release 0.7.0 (2011-11-04)
-------------

### Changes:
* A monastery in town can heal, remove curses and cure the most common
  diseases for a little. Some special items are available in the
  monastery's shop.
* Implemented a "storage room" at the player's home. It is now possible
  to store items at home and take them later. Items stored there are
  added to the player's score when the game ends.
* Scribes in the school of Larn can write any scroll on blank scrolls.
* Stop automatic movement or resting as soon as a monster enters the
  field of vision, not only when it is on a field next to the player.
  This should give the player more time to react accordingly.
* Spells that cause effects to the player now extend the effect amount
  or duration up to (spell knowledge level * base value). Messages are
  displayed to reflect that an effect has been extended or that the
  maximum has been reached.
* Added an intelligence requirement to learning spells and extended the
  requirement for casting spells to 3 * spell level.
* Implemented raising taxes:
  For every difficulty level > 0 the player has to pay 5% of the income,
  i.e. money deposited on the bank, item sale revenue and interest as
  taxes. The maximum tax percentage is 20%.
  Added statistics about paid taxes to the obituary.
* Added traps to containers. Every generated container has a 33% chance
  of being trapped. Trap effects are:
   * itching (forces the player to remove the armour),
   * sickness (reduce chance to hit)
   * clumsiness (forces the player to the weapon)
   * slowness
* Implemented searching for traps on the ground or on containers.
  Searching is also useful to examine the surroundings when blinded.
* Containers known to be trapped are displayed as e.g. "trapped bag".
* Enhanced targeting mode:
  * target the closest monster if no previous selection has been made.
  * switch between visible monsters with SPACE.
  * remember the last targeted monster for subsequent targeting.
  * remember the monster last hit with a direct attack.
* Added ranged weapons and ammunition (fire with 'f').
* Added new item slots: secondary weapon and quiver.
* Enabled swapping primary and secondary weapon ('x').
* Implemented a "paperdoll", a list of all equipped items ('TAB').
* Implemented throwing of potions ('t').
* Most potions now work on monsters.
* Made the potion of holy water dangerous for undead monsters.
* Thrown or fired items will be picked up automatically regardless of
  autopickup settings.
* Added a command (M) to cast the previous spell again.
* It is now possible to pay with money stuffed in carried containers.
  The leprechaun can now to steal money hidden inside carried containers.
* Tweaked the behaviour of the townsfolk. They will no longer walk around
  like drunk, do important town people business and only talk when the
  player is outside a building.
* Started to work on summoned monsters:
  * summoned monsters can follow the player,
  * do not impact automatic movement,
  * its possible to swap positions with them,
  * they disappear after some turns,
  * and killing them gives no experience points.
  This is a work in progress and not at all completed.
* Added monster's weapon to monster's description.
* Implemented a mana drain trap.
* Added dynamic help to the inventory dialog.
* Messages and dialogues can now be coloured, some already are.
* Spell rays or blasts now have different colours.
* Modified effect list display on the right side of the screen:
  * unique entries only
  * positive effects coloured cyan
  * negative effects coloured magenta
  * fading effects coloured red
* Door glyphs now depend on the position of the door.
  For closed horizontal doors, it is '-', for vertical doors '|'. Opened
  doors are displayed as '/', but for double doors they become a pair
  of '/' and '\'.
* Reduced availability of rings in store at game start.
* Generate amulets starting on level 6 and do not generate a ring every
  time generating an amulet failed; choose a random item type instead.
  This should reduce the excessive amount of rings available in the game.
* Toggling the visibility of the entire map in wizard mode with ^V.
* Redefined quite a lot of keys, the most important being:
  * 'S' -> 'CTRL-S' (save)
  * 'Q' -> 'CTRL-Q' (quit)
  * 'T' -> 'V' (travel, silly memory hook: voyage)

### Fixed bugs:

* Purge dead monsters after player's extra moves (fixes crash bug).
* Only curse-id blessable items when dropping them on an altar.
* Fixed weight calculation for stackable items.

  restoring a game frequently. Reported by Peter Casey and Michael Ax.

  description returned "An uninjured elf, fleeing ()." for an elf
  affected by "phantasmal forces".

  pieces of code that potentially could have caused crashes.
* Make aborted spells not cost turns.
* Fix an assertion when aborting phantasmal forces and an information
  leak in that spell.

  is necessary if we want to stock the DND store differently depending
  on whether a game is started in wizard mode or not.

* Fixed many memory leaks.
* Fixed a typo.
