	Welcome to NLarn!

The goal of the game is to find the potion to cure your daughter from the 
illness "diantrorithis" and bring it back home. Time is finite - when you
return to your home, the doctor will tell you how much time is left. In 
NLarn, time is measured in mobuls. A mobul consists of 100 turns. You can 
see the number of turns elapsed in the status bar on the right, prefixed 
with "T". 

The game consists of a home town, and two dungeons: the caverns of Larn and 
the volcano. The potion is hidden inside the volcano, which is unfortunately 
populated by dragons and demons. To be able to fight the latter, you have to 
gain experience and wealth by fighting through the caverns. The equipment 
available in the DND store in town is expensive, but will help you to survive
in the volcano long enough to find the potion. To earn money, you can collect
gems in the caverns and sell them to the bank.

The entrance of the caverns is depicted by the letter 'O'; the shaft leading 
down to the volcano by the letter 'I'.

You can get help inside the game by pressing '?' or 'F1'.

News about NLarn are posted to the website at

* Configuration 

You can predefine some settings in the file nlarn.ini. You can find a sample 
in the installation directory. The game looks for this file in the directory 

	~/.nlarn 

on *nix or 

	%APPDATA%\nlarn

on Windows. 


* Heritage

NLarn is modeled after Larn, which was written by Noah Morgan in 1986.
For an in-depth review of Larn, have a look at

	http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/04/play_larn_or_i_hocked_the_car.php.

Later in the eigthies, Phil Cordier created ULarn, an extended version of 
Larn. It comes with more levels, items and adds character classes to the 
game. 

NLarn tries to maintain the atmosphere and story of the last version of 
Larn (12.3) while improving game-play and user experience. Only a few of 
the additions of Ularn have been included.
