    * Modified keys for open/close and magic: 
        * 'o'pen (instead of 'O')
        * 'c'lose (instead of 'C')
        * 'm'agic (instead of 'c'ast)
    * Add fast movement command that uses the following (direction) input 
      for running (g).
    * Implement a long-rest command: (w)ait which will ignore adjacent 
      floating eyes und umber hulks.
    * Added functionality to (r)ead/(q)uaff/(e)quip/(t)ake off/(d)rop an 
      item quickly.
    * Remember visited landmarks. A list of these can be shown with (D).

    * The message history is shown reversed and the entries are prefixed 
      with their turn number. Truncate the message log to 100 entries.
    * Enhanced the dialogue to get a number: set overwrite mode as 
      default; accept 'y', 'g', 'd' and 'p' as the full amount and 'n' as 0 
      to speed up getting and dropping multiple items. 
    * Ask for the player's name and sex during game creation if not set in 
      .ini file or by command line parameters.
    * Prompt if a fireball is going to hit the player.

    * Display items and stationary objects which are not in sight with 
      their colour to make finding them again easier. New display order:

      gems > gold > topmost item.
    * Made containers ask for the amount when putting things into/taking 
      things out.
    * Open doors by walking into them, though not on shift-run.
    * Modified some monster glyphs. 
    * Make the potion of cure dianthroritis expensive. This is a simple

      get more money for it than for a corroded dagger.

      it.

      perfect, wich item to identify or to uncurse when using the uncursed 
      variant.

    * Call autopickup when entering a new level. 
    * Disallow opening/closing doors while paralysed or overstrained.

      warp.

      has to be targeted by the spell.
