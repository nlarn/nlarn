Running means moving into one direction until interrupted. `KEY`g`end` or `KEY`/`end`, followed by a direction key, will similarly make your run.


`TITLE`Auto-travel`end`

`KEY`v`end`   voyage (travel) to a location on the level
`KEY`V`end`   continue travelling

You can select the travel target by moving the cursor or by typing the desired feature's symbol (e.g. `KEY`_`end` for an altar). Subsequent key presses will move the cursor around if there are more than one of the desired features on the level. You can return the cursor to your character by pressing `KEY`@`end`. When finished, press ENTER to start the journey. When a foe comes into sight, travelling will be aborted automatically and can be continued with `KEY`V`end` when the enemy gets out of sight.

`TITLE`Game Time`end`
The game time is counted in `EMPH`turns`end`. Usually, moving a single step consumes one turn, but may, depending on your speed, take less or more time. All other creatures in the caverns also vary largely in their rapidness. There is rumor about magical items that may affect the speed of an animate being.

More complex actions, such as using an item, consume multiple turns. Whenever you are concerned with something for a while and your health is endangered, you are offered to abort your current deed. Unfortunately, all turns spent so far are lost.

The larnian unit of time is the `EMPH`mobul`end`. It consists of one hundred turns.

`EMPH`The second column`end` shows the spell's name.
`EMPH`The third column`end` shows the level of the spell, which is used to determine the MP usage of that spell.
`EMPH`The forth column`end` shows the character's knowledge level of that spell. The higher the knowledge level is, the more powerful is the effect of the spell.


`TITLE`Wizard Mode Actions`end`

Wizard mode is used to debug the game; therefore it is impossible to die in wizard mode. You will gain insight into otherwise hidden details of the game. Once you enter wizard mode, there is no way back; any progress made during wizard mode will not make it to the high score list.
